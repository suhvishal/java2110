capabilities 


FrontEnd web applications 

    - HTML 
        - "what" contents you want to place on the web page 
        - "define the structure" of web pages 

    - CSS  - cascading style sheet 
        - "how" content should appear on the webpage 
        - "define style rules" for the webpages   

    - JavaScript 
        - provide programming functionalities on webpages 
        - javascript code executes only inside the browser 
                - every browser has a javascript engine which executes js code 
        - introduced in 1997
        - 1997, it was submitted to ECMA for standardization
        - sine then, ECMA keeps publishing diff specifications called
        - and these specifications are implemented by diff browsers 
                - this implementation is called as 'ECMAScript' 
        - 1997      - ES1
        - 1998      - ES2
        - 1999      - ES3
        - 2009      - ES5
        - 2015      - ES6
    
        - using javacript 
            - DOM Manipulation 
            - CSS Manipulation 
            - Calculation/ business logic 
            - event handling 
            - form validations 
            - ajax calls 

    - ES6 / ECMAScript 2015 / Advanced JavaScript 
            - this specification introduced a lot of features in javascript 
                - Arrow functions, spread operators, async and await, generators, classes and objects, 
                - Module System 

    - JQuery 
        - it is javasript library, which simplify some tasks 

    - Bootstrap 
        - provides lot of css classes to create beautiful and responsive web pages 
        - html5+css3+jquery






Others 
    - ReactJS (library)
    - VueJS (library)
    - EmberJS (Framework)

Pre-requisites 

    - JavaScript 
        - it is an interpreted language 
        - it is executed by javascript engine inside the browser
        - it is not type safe 


    - TypeScript 
        - it is developed and maintained by microsoft 
        - it is a superset of javascript/ES6 
        - it has all the features of ES6 + some additional features i.e types, decorators, generics etc. 
        - it is a compiled language i.e. TS code is compiled into JS code (es6)
        - it cannot be executed in the browser


        - hello.ts --------> hello.js 



What is Angular 
    - framework
        - contains modules / libraries 
    - it is managed & maintained by google 

Environment Setup for Angular 
---------------------------------

    1. nodejs 12.x 
        - nodejs comes with a depedency management tools called 'npm'

    2. Editor
            - VS Code 
            - Intellij Idea 
            - Atom 
            - any editor  

    3. angular-cli 
            - command line tool to create/manage angular projects 
            - npm install -g @angular/cli

            > ng --version 


Helloworld angular app 
---------------------------
    > ng new <<nameofapp>>


Angular Framework
---------------------
        @angular/core
        @angular/forms 
        @angular/common 
        @angular/animations
        @angular/platform-browser
        @angular/....



Angular Building Blocks 
--------------------------
    1. Component 
            - this is the most imp building block 
            - Angular applications are made up of Components 
            - component is used to render a 'view' on the page 
            - Component is a typescript class which encapsulates data, view and logic together 
            --** every angular applicatio has at least one Component, usually called as "AppComponent" 

                        app.component.ts 
                        app.component.html 




                header.component.ts 
                ======================                

                    import {Component} from '@angular/core'

                    @Component({
                        selector : 'app-header',
                        templateUrl : 'header-component.html'
                    })
                    class HeaderComponent {
                        //data / fields 

                        //methods / logic 
                    }

                header.component.html
                =======================
                    <div>
                        <p> this is header component </p>
                    </div>


                <app-header> </app-header>      //component is loaded 


                -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                product.component.ts 
                ======================                

                    import {Component} from '@angular/core'

                    @Component({
                        selector : 'app-product',
                        templateUrl : 'product-component.html'
                    })
                    class ProductComponent {
                        //data / fields 
                        //fieldname

                        //methods / logic 
                    }

                product.component.html
                =======================
                    <div>
                        <p> this is product component </p>
                    </div>


    2. Template 
        - template is the 'view' which is rendered/controlled by component
        - it is made using html  


    3. Module 
    ---------------
            - it is a container to describe/register metadata and  the entities of the applications 
                    i.e. components, directives, services, pipes, etc. etc. 
            - module is also a typescript class 
            -** every angular application has at least one module .. usually called as "AppModule"

            import {NgModule} from '@angular/core'


            @NgModule({
                declarations : [...declare/regiser all components, directives and pipes ]
                imports:[...declare/import all the submodules/othermodules]
                providers : [..declare the services ],
                bootstrap: [...specify which component to bootstrap when the app starts]
            })
            class AppModule{

            }

        Create a new component 
        ------------------------
           >  ng generate component Header

           or 

           > ng g c Header 

        
        databinding 
        -------------------
            - communication between component and template 

            1. string interpolation 
                  <h1>  {{ fieldname }}  </h1>

                    - output some text dynamically 
                    - output some text into heading, paragraph, div etc. 

            2. Property binding 
                - <element [domProperty]="fieldname">
                - <img [src]="imageUrl" />

                <input type="text" [value]="fieldname" />

                - is used to bind/assign value of a field (property/datamember in component) 
                        to a domProperty of an element 


            3. event binding 
                    <element (domEvent)="method()" />


                    <button (click)="doSomething()">
                        Show me!
                    </button>


            4. Class binding  - 
                    binding value of a field to the class attribute 

                    <element class="CSS-class" />
